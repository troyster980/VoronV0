[filament_switch_sensor filament_sensor]
#detection_length: 10.0
#   The minimum length of filament pulled through the sensor to trigger
#   a state change on the switch_pin
#   Default is 7 mm.
#extruder: extruder
#   The name of the extruder section this sensor is associated with.
#   This parameter must be provided.
switch_pin: PC15 #Estop SKR mini E3 v2, 
#   The pin on which the switch is connected. This parameter must be
#   provided.
pause_on_runout: True
#   When set to True, a PAUSE will execute immediately after a runout
#   is detected. Note that if pause_on_runout is False and the
#   runout_gcode is omitted then runout detection is disabled. Default
#   is True.
runout_gcode:
    M117 Runout Detected
    heating_up #turn lights red
    
    #RESPOND TYPE=error MSG="Filament Runout!"   #respond a warning message 
##   Need enable the "M118" and "RESPOND" extended commands first.

    #M117 Filament Runout!                       #Sent a message to LCD
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after a filament 
# runout is detected. If pause_on_runout is set to True this G-Code 
# will run after the PAUSE is complete. The default is not to 
# run any G-Code commands.
insert_gcode:
    M117 Insert Detected
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after a filament insert is detected.
# The default is not to run any G-Code commands,  
# which disables insert detection.
#event_delay: 3.0
#   The minimum amount of time in seconds to delay between events.
#   Events triggered during this time period will be silently
#   ignored. The default is 3 seconds.
pause_delay: 0.5
#   The amount of time to delay, in seconds, between the pause command
#   dispatch and execution of the runout_gcode. It may be useful to
#   increase this delay if OctoPrint exhibits strange pause behavior.
#   Default is 0.5 seconds.
